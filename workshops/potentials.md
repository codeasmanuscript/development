# Potential workshops to give #

* Data management
* Macros (basic, intermediate, advanced)
* ODS output
    * Mixing in data manipulation/editing
* Git or version control in general
    * Maybe do an interactive (using etherpad), team assignment to
      show the benefits of using VCS. Like all create a github
      account, create a practice assignment, and merge/work together
      to do an analysis. Like split the group up into a few teams, get
      one group to generate data, another to analyze it, and another
      to make plots or something simple of course.
    * Like do one of the other workshops this way, teaching two things
      at once to show that git/VCS should be an integral part of doing
      any analysis.  Like one group figure out what ODS to use, an
      other to build the macro.
* R graphs or exploratory graphics
* R functions
* Reproducible research (basics of best practices on coding, folder
  structure, running scripts, etc.)
* How to select the appropriate stat test
* How to handle and find errors and bugs in code
* Proper coding practices (a workshop on its own? or mixed in)
    * Or thrown in with other workshops
* Tutorial on how coding/programming software works (its important to
  understand to grasp other concepts (e.g. macros, ODS, etc.))
