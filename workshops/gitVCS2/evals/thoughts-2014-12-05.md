Thoughts on the (title) workshop --- Data
=========================================

**Luke**:

- Went slow but at same time too fast for some.
- Mis-judged level of understanding on computing (i.e. git and file structure). Lower level from last time.
- Slower pace was good, as it allowed them to catch up.
- Need to focus the goal and activity down more, get it specific.
- Didn't go over GitHub, not enough time.

**Daiva**:

- Went at a slow pace
- Did understand the concept of version control and why it's important
- Ability to keep up with the material varied from person to person --> difficult to assist everyone in a timely fashion without taking away time from workshop objectives.

**General**:

Went well, but noticeably different from the last group. Were able to cover more material with the last group (e.g. branches). Must focus hands-on activity more.
