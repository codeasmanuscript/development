<p>Hello DNSers!</p>
<p>We have another workshop on Git (+ GitHub) that will go over how to use Git as a backup tool, as a log of all your work, and to make collaboration (with other graduate students, your labmates, or other researchers) easier than ever! Git is a powerful tool to help make your life a lot easier! Contact Luke (luke.johnston@mail.utoronto.ca) or Daiva (daiva.nielsen@mail.utoronto.ca) for more info.</p>

<p>Title: 'Git'-ing better: Collaborating on your research with version control and GitHub</p>
<p>Using Dropbox as a backup for your files? Working with multiple people on a project that involves working on the same files and data? Want to get your research out there more? Well, using Git and GitHub can make all of these things much easier!!</p>
<p>We had some great feedback from our previous workshop on using Git and version control to better keep track of your data and your analyses. Version control is so powerful and useful, we decided to go over more of it, especially for using it as a tool to make collaboration easy and for keeping a detailed history of everything you ever did to your files.</p>
