Hey everyone!

Since you all had indicated interest in our workshops, here is our next workshop we are going to be running!

## Brief Summary ##

We will be going over how to use Git and GitHub to version control your files and data, to backup your important research, and to make it easier to collaborate on projects with other graduate students, your labmates, or other researchers!

Before coming:

* Register [here](eventbrite link)
* Install software (Git, SAS, or R) on laptop (see below)
* Bring fully charged laptop!

## 'Git'-ing better: Collaborating on your research with version control and GitHub ##

Using Dropbox as a backup for your files?  Working with multiple people on a project that involves working on the same files and data?  Want to get your research out there more?  Well, using Git and GitHub can make all of these things much easier!!

We had some great feedback from our previous workshop on using Git and version control to better keep track of your data and your analyses.  Version control is so powerful and useful, we decided to go over more of it, especially for using it as a tool to make collaboration easy and for keeping a detailed history of everything you ever did to your files.

## Before coming to the workshop: ##

### Install Git ###

Installing instructions from the [Git download site](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* On Windows

    Download the installer exe file and run it from this [Github link](http://msysgit.github.io)

* On Mac

    To use the graphical Git installer, download from this [SourceForge link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/)

* On Linux

    Install through your package manager (for example, if you use Ubuntu, run this code: `sudo apt-get install git`

### Getting a text editor ###

Because we will be writing a fake report using something called Markdown, you will need to install a plain text editor (or use a currently installed one).

* Windows

    Notepad is installed by default, however [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html) is really good.  Another option is [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/).

* Mac

    [TextMate](http://macromates.com/download) is good, check the website to install it.

* Linux

    There are a number of good options available to easily install. Check out gedit. Your distro likely has it in its package management repos.

### Using or getting a statistical program ###

We will be using SAS to run analyses.  But! If you don't have it already and don't want to pay the high cost for the SAS license, you can use R (which is free) instead.  Instructions for download can be found at on the [R website](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/).  A good editor for R is [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk).  If you need any help, come a bit early before the workshop and we'll try to help out.
