Hello DNSers!

We are putting together another workshop on Git and using it to easily collaborate with others on your research.  We will be going over how to use Git and GitHub to version control your files and data, to backup your important research, and to make it easier to collaborate on projects with other graduate students, your labmates, or other researchers!

## Extended description of the workshop: ##

Title: 'Git'-ing better: Collaborating on your research with version control and GitHub

Using Dropbox as a backup for your files?  Working with multiple people on a project that involves working on the same files and data?  Want to get your research out there more?  Well, using Git and GitHub can make all of these things much easier!!

We had some great feedback from our previous workshop on using Git and version control to better keep track of your data and your analyses.  Version control is so powerful and useful, we decided to go over more of it, especially for using it as a tool to make collaboration easy and for keeping a detailed history of everything you ever did to your files.

Contact Luke or Daiva for more information and to register.
