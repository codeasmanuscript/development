Hey everyone!

Since you all had indicated interest in our workshops, here is our first workshop we will be running!

## Let's "Git" started! An introduction to version control. ##

Have you ever made changes to a document and a week later wished you could change it back? Have you ever changed direction in your analysis and changed your code in SAS or R (or others), later regretting it?  Have you ever wanted to play around with your analysis and try new techniques, but don't want to have to create a whole other file to redo the analysis? How about sending around a manuscript/thesis and have multiple versions in your folder? Do you wish there was a better way of doing things? Well you are in luck, there is a better way! It's called **version control**!

We (Luke and Daiva) are doing a workshop on how to manage multiple versions of files, how to make trying new techniques easier, and how to keep a history of what you do to a file. The primary activity of workshop will involve (briefly) analyzing a test dataset and writing a fake report... All done collaboratively through Git.

This is the first workshop in a series of data-related workshops.  The reason **why we are teaching Git first** is because we will be **using Git for all subsequent workshops**.

### Register... or not ###

While we gladly welcome anyone to come and join, it would really help us better prepare for the workshop if we know how many are coming. So, please register for this workshop using this [Eventbrite link]().

### Before coming to the workshop: ###

#### Install Git ####

Installing instructions from the [Git download site](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* On Windows

    Download the installer exe file and run it from this [Github link](http://msysgit.github.io)

* On Mac

    To use the graphical Git installer, download from this [SourceForge link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/)

* On Linux

    Install through your package manager (for example, if you use Ubuntu, run this code: ``sudo apt-get install git``

#### Getting a text editor ####

Because we will be writing a fake report using something called Markdown, you will need to install a plain text editor (or use a currently installed one).

* Windows

    Notepad is installed by default, however [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html) is really good.  Another option is [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/).

* Mac

    [TextMate](http://macromates.com/download) is good, check the website to install it.

* Linux

    There are a number of good options available to easily install. Check out gedit. Your distro likely has it in its package management repos.

#### Using or getting a statistical program ####

We will be using SAS to run analyses.  But! If you don't have it already and don't want to pay the high cost for the SAS license, you can use R (which is free) instead.  Instructions for download can be found at on the [R website](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/).  A good editor for R is [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk).  If you need any help, come a bit early before the workshop and we'll try to help out.
