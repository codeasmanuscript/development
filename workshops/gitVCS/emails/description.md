Hello DNSers!

Thank you for completing our SurveyMonkey in Septemeber. We (Daiva and Luke) are very excited to announce the topic of our first workshop--version control! Please read below for a more detailed description of what this is and why it is useful for graduate students to know about. We will hold several unique workshops this year that will take place on a (more or less) monthly basis in room FG423. The workshops will last approximately 2 hours, but we will aim to cover all relevant concepts in the first hour, and reserve the second hour for more in depth hands-on tutorials and time for Q&A.

In order to find the most convenient time to schedule our first workshop, we ask you to complete the following Doodle by Tuesday, October 21. Please indicate all times during the first week of November when you will be free for 2 hours between 10am and 6pm. We are food friendly as a very viable scheduling option for these workshops is during an extended lunch hour during weekdays, so if you are free during typical lunch times (11am-1pm, 12pm-2pm, etc.) let us know!

Thanks!  Daiva & Luke


### Extended description of the workshop: ###

Title: Let's "Git" started! An introduction to version control.

Have you ever made changes to a document and a week later wished you could change it back? Have you ever changed direction in your analysis and changed your code in SAS or R (or others), later regretting it?  Have you ever wanted to play around with your analysis and try new techniques, but don't want to have to create a whole other file to redo the analysis? How about sending around a manuscript/thesis and have multiple versions in your folder? Do you wish there was a better way of doing things? Well you are in luck, there is a better way! It's called **version control**!

We (Luke and Daiva) are doing a workshop on how to manage multiple versions of files, how to make trying new techniques easier, and how to keep a history of what you do to a file and to your analyses. The primary activity of the workshop will involve (briefly) analyzing a test dataset and writing a fake report... All done collaboratively through Git!

An **important note**. The **reason** why we are **teaching Git first** is because we will be **using Git for all subsequent workshops**. Future workshops will cover data management strategies, statistical tests and assumptions, condensing code writing using macros, and data visualization techniques (graphs, tables, etc.), all while **also using Git**.

We will be in touch 2 weeks before Workshop 1 with a Registration link and instructions on what you will need to install on your laptop before coming to the workshop. Stay tuned!!
