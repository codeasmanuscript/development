Hi everyone,

Thanks very much for coming out to our first DNS version control workshop. The slides, Git cheatsheet and Etherpad notes (in a text file) are all available from our GitHub:
https://github.com/codeasmanuscript/development/tree/master/workshops/gitVCS

In our next workshop we will cover more topics about Git and GitHub. We will give you more hands-on exercises to practice working with Git so you can see how it will be useful in your day-to-day research work. We will send an Eventbright link and reminder closer to the date, which is Friday, December 5 from 2-4pm in FG423. Remember again to bring a fully charged laptop and if you could have some sort of statistical analysis software installed, that would be terrific.

Thanks!

Luke and Daiva
