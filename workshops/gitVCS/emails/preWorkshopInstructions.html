<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Since you all had indicated interest in our workshops, here is our first workshop we will be running!</p>
<h2 id="lets-git-started-an-introduction-to-version-control.">Let's &quot;Git&quot; started! An introduction to version control.</h2>
<p>Have you ever made changes to a document and a week later wished you could change it back? Have you ever changed direction in your analysis and changed your code in SAS or R (or others), later regretting it? Have you ever wanted to play around with your analysis and try new techniques, but don't want to have to create a whole other file to redo the analysis? How about sending around a manuscript/thesis and have multiple versions in your folder? Do you wish there was a better way of doing things? Well you are in luck, there is a better way! It's called <strong>version control</strong>!</p>
<p>We (Luke and Daiva) are doing a workshop on how to manage multiple versions of files, how to make trying new techniques easier, and how to keep a history of what you do to a file. The primary activity of workshop will involve (briefly) analyzing a test dataset and writing a fake report... All done collaboratively through Git.</p>
<p>This is the first workshop in a series of data-related workshops. The reason <strong>why we are teaching Git first</strong> is because we will be <strong>using Git for all subsequent workshops</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="before-coming-to-the-workshop">Before coming to the workshop:</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install Git</h4>
<p>Installing instructions from the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Git download site</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>On Windows</p>
<p>Download the installer exe file and run it from this <a href="http://msysgit.github.io">Github link</a></p></li>
<li><p>On Mac</p>
<p>To use the graphical Git installer, download from this <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/">SourceForge link</a></p></li>
<li><p>On Linux</p>
<p>Install through your package manager (for example, if you use Ubuntu, run this code: <code>sudo apt-get install git</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="getting-a-text-editor">Getting a text editor</h4>
<p>Because we will be writing a fake report using something called Markdown, you will need to install a plain text editor (or use a currently installed one).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Windows</p>
<p>Notepad is installed by default, however <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html">Notepad++</a> is really good. Another option is <a href="http://markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Mac</p>
<p><a href="http://macromates.com/download">TextMate</a> is good, check the website to install it.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux</p>
<p>There are a number of good options available to easily install. Check out gedit. Your distro likely has it in its package management repos.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="using-or-getting-a-statistical-program">Using or getting a statistical program</h4>
<p>We will be using SAS to run analyses. But! If you don't have it already and don't want to pay the high cost for the SAS license, you can use R (which is free) instead. Instructions for download can be found at on the <a href="http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/">R website</a>. A good editor for R is <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk">RStudio</a>. If you need any help, come a bit early before the workshop and we'll try to help out.</p>
