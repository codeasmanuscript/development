<p>Let's &quot;Git&quot; started! An introduction to version control.</p>
<p><em>Description</em>:</p>
<p>Have you ever made changes to a document and a week later wished you could change it back? Have you ever changed direction in your analysis and changed your code in SAS or R (or others), later regretting it? Have you ever wanted to play around with your analysis and try new techniques, but don't want to have to create a whole other file to redo the analysis? How about sending around a manuscript/thesis and have multiple versions in your folder? Do you wish there was a better way of doing things? Well you are in luck, there is a better way! It's called <em>version control</em>!</p>
<p>We (Luke and Daiva) are doing a workshop on how to manage multiple versions of files, how to make trying new techniques easier, and how to keep a history of what you do to a file. The primary activity of workshop will involve (briefly) analyzing a test dataset and writing a fake report... All done collaboratively through Git.</p>
<p>This is the first workshop in a series of data-related workshops. The reason <em>why we are teaching Git first</em> is because we will be <em>using Git for all subsequent workshops</em>.</p>
<p><em>Time</em>:</p>
<p>4:00-6:00pm</p>
