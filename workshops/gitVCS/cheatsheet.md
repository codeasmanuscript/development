# Cheatsheet: Useful (and common) Git commands #

Git is an amazing and very powerful tool that is useful for managing your projects and tools.  However, because of its power and usefulness, it can be confusing for beginners because of the need to use the command line (or terminal) to run Git commands as well as the large number of commands and options available.  So, we put together the commands that are the most useful and most common --- and the only ones you may ever use!

Git commands:

git clone ---

 :  Take an existing git repository (aka project, aka folders and
    files) and duplicate/copy/clone it.  For example, I have a folder
    called `diabetesAndObesity` that contains all of my data,
    analysis, and manuscript on my research regarding diabetes and
    obesity.  If you wanted to collaborate with me on the project, you
    would run `git clone` on my project to copy all of the files and
    folders and Git history into your computer.

git log ---

 :  Log

git status ~ Status
