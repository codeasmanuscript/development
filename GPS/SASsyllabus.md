**Code as Manuscript: Analytical Practices in SAS for Data Efficiency and Reproducibility**

**Course Syllabus**


**Instructors**

Luke Johnston, MSc, PhD (C):
luke.johnston@mail.utoronto.ca

Daiva Nielsen, PhD: daiva.nielsen@mail.utoronto.ca

**Class day, time and location:** 2 hours per class is requested
 	 
**Course description:** 
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the concept of research reproducibility and present methods of conducting statistical analyses in a more efficient, less error prone way. Tips for increasing the efficiency of collaborative work will also be presented. The content will be tailored specifically to SAS users. The ultimate goal of the course is to demonstrate how to reduce the number of steps required to produce a manuscript from the data analysis stage. Students will be expected to bring their own fully-charged laptop to each class with the appropriate software installed (Git, a text editor and SAS). Emphasis will be placed on hands-on practice activities integrated into each weekly class.

**Suggested preparation:** Working knowledge of SAS, some experience with the command line or familiarity with computing. 

**Intended audience:** Graduate students or post-doctoral fellows who work with large-scale cohort or clinical databases.

**Course objectives:**

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Track their research files with Git to control multiple versions of files.
* Operate GitHub to maintain a back-up of files and have an outlet for efficient collaboration.
* Create macros to condense statistical code writing.
* Use ODS to output results into a more useable form.


**Course Schedule**

Week 1 	Introduction to version control with Git
Week 2 	GitHub
Week 3 	Macro-coding
Week 4 	Output Delivery System (ODS)
Week 5	Review and practice (optional)
