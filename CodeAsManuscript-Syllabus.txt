 Course description: 
The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the concept of research reproducibility and present methods of conducting statistical analyses in a more efficient, less error prone way. The ultimate goal of the course is to demonstrate how to reduce the number of steps required to produce a manuscript from the data analysis stage. Students will be expected to bring their own fully-charged laptop to each class with the appropriate software installed (Git, a text editor and a statistical analysis software). Emphasis will be placed on hands-on practice activities integrated into each weekly class.

Course objectives:
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
•	Track their research files with Git to control multiple versions of files.
•	Operate GitHub to maintain a back-up of files and have an outlet for efficient collaboration.
•	Create macros to condense statistical code writing.
•	Use ODS to output results into a more useable form.
