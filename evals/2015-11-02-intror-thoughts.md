Thoughts on the Intro to R workshop
===================================

**Luke**:

I thought it went pretty good. First things first! Sarah did an excellent job
taking the lead instructor for the intro to R session, which was the first time
she taught it and it was the first time it was taught in *Code As
Manuscript*. She had great enthusiasm, had a good pace, and did a great job of
making sure the students followed along. Two things I would suggest as a future
improvement would be 1) to put more emphasis to the "What's the point" or "Why
bother?" points and 2) to try not to do as much 'umm' :P

Feedback for the material (this applies to both of us, since we both had a stake
in developing it): I think it was a good first round for lessons. However, I
feel that the quantity of material was overly optimistic. I did anticipate that
the intro material would be a difficult lesson to teach as learners are
introduced to a lot of unknown material, eg. new app to use (RStudio), new
commands, new programming environment. I would like to truncate the material and
focus in on a tighter core of commands to teach and go into more depth with. For
instance, I think functions are super important and going over them should take
a good chunk of time.

**General**:

Students seemed to be following along fairly well. There was that hiccup with
loading the data, but future iterations of this lesson will smooth that out.
