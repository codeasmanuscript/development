Thoughts on the (title) workshop --- Data
=========================================

**Luke**:

I felt it went very well. Might have been a bit fast at some parts, but I
definitely think this session was one of the best I've done yet for git! Slowly
but steadily getting better. Got good feedback from the Ticket Out the Door
surveys, which re-confirms my feeling.
