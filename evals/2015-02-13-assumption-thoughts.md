Thoughts on the Stats assumption workshop
=========================================

**Luke**:

Great job overall, went pretty smoothly.  Unfortunately, only one attendee had a laptop, so others couldn't really follow along using the coding.

Some parts went a bit fast and could have been explained more.

**Daiva**:

Went smoothly, unfortunate that only 1 attendee brought their laptop. 

I should have gone more slowly with the SAS codes. Explain the lines in the code next time. What the procedure is, if there is a graphing/plotting feature, what relationship is being investigated (X and Y variables), if you can add in your covariates. 

Improvement for future: have a more complex dataset. Look into SAS datasets more in depth or generate fake data (can do this in SAS). Would be more applicable to have more covariates in the examples.


**General**:

Good group, everyone was familiar with SAS; it was more relaxed because of this.
