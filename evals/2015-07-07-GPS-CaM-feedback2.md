Email from a participant:

What could we improve and what worked (either for the material or for
the teaching)?

> The objectives were succinct and realistic enough to be achieved given
> the short period of the workshop. In the future, perhaps a follow-up
> workshop to build on the bare essentials we learned or risk losing it
> without adequate and meaningful practice.


Was the content clearly explained and demonstrated?

> Yes, although more practical application relevant to our needs would
> make the knowledge more concrete.


How useful were the activities?

> The usefulness lies more on the potential for future
> applications. However, the learning activities were often sufficient
> in achieving the set objectives.


Would you recommend today's + the other workshop to others?

> Yes, definitely. I would reiterate though that post workshop
> supplementary or support activities would help further develop learned
> skills from this workshop.
