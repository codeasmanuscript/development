Thoughts on the Macros + ODS workshop
=====================================

**Luke**:

Macros:

* I felt that raw live coding would have been better but I understand
  cause still new to macros
* Intro and the slides went well, good pacing
* Could have waited longer when asking if there were questions or
  maybe change the question asked ("Does anyone have any questions?"
  to "Should I go over that again? Am I explaining this well enough?"
  etc.)

ODS:

* I need to explain somethings a bit more (some of the code)
* Felt the pacing was good
* I didn't explain **why** learning ODS was a good idea, so next time
  I need to convince them why students should take the time to learn
  these code/techniques

**Daiva**:

Macros:

* I think the pace was good
* I think the spoken analogies and explanations were useful
* Some parts of the practice code felt disconnected, or not really
  practical (proc contents, proc print)

ODS:

* Extremely hands-on, students responded well to it
* Good explanation and interpretation of techniques, why they were
  useful
* Some students were falling behind on keeping up with code, may need
  to go slower
* Neutral: Concept of loop was shown and explained in general (but not
  specifics due to time constraints). Is it worth including? If so,
  how? Longer workshop or remove something else?
* Like the idea of keep what came before and build onto the code

**General**:

* We should split up code and output (split screen), so we can show
  the output, but also keep the code there too so others can keep
  typing
* We had some problem with the wifi, which isn't always in our
  control... May need to just make sure things are ok next time
* Some people didn't bring a laptop... While this workshop really
  should be done hands-on, we really can't do anything about it since
  SAS is proprietary and costs a fair amount to install
