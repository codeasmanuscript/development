Thoughts on the (title) workshop --- Data
=========================================

**Luke**:

- I thought the workshop went quite well.  The beginning maybe felt a
  little wooden and repetitive from last week, but other than that I
  felt like it went *better* than last week's git session!
- Even though there were some problems with trying to get the merge
  conflict to show up, I really think this is actually a very *good*
  thing!  It just shows how hard it is to get a merge conflict with
  Git!
- Some problems I noticed related to mainly going a bit fast on the
  GitHub page.  I personally didn't find it hard, but there were
  several students who did not see what was clicked, or who fell a bit
  behind.  This is normal, but maybe slowing the pace would be useful
  next time.
- Like I said, I felt like this lesson was better than last weeks
  because the reason for learning Git and GitHub was much clearer and
  more tangible.  I really like it and I think we should incorporate
  Git and GitHub in both sessions from now on.
