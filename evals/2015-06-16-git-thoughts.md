Thoughts on the (title) workshop --- Data
=========================================

**Luke**:

- I think I need to figure out a better way to 'contextualize' the
  importance of git, ie, use a real-life example or something...

- I felt the workshop went well, but I could have explained some
  things better.  Taken it slower.  Clear the terminal screen more.

- Next time I need to get more of the students to tell us what is
  going on.  To make sure we are on the same page.  Also, make sure to
  wait more to see that everyone is all good.  Some may feel bad about
  asking questions or not understanding something, which I need to
  keep mindful of.

- I might have rushed things a bit too.

- Next time I'll get them to do some practice on their own, rather
  than me just telling them.

**Daiva**:

- Ensure that everyone has program downloaded. Check in with them as
  they arrive.

- Clarify what the split screen is displaying.

- Refine introductory point about programming/using a command
  line. Clarify that this is what they will be using throughout the
  workshop series, why this is useful, acknowledge that the majority
  of people have practically no experience with it, and assure them
  that they can learn how to perform some basic tasks with it
  comfortably. Lots of positive reinforcement because this is so new
  to so many people.

- Refine explanation/utility of version control so that this gets
  explicit points/learning objectives across. Should be able to do
  verbal overview of Git in 15--20 minutes. Factoring in intros and
  housekeeping items about the workshop (Etherpad, syllabus,
  assignments, GPS credit), should be able to start coding ~30 minutes
  into the workshop.

- Take a bit of time to teach tab completion and up/down arrow history
  scrolling. Will make it easier for students to type in code. Can
  integrate up/down arrow scrolling with git config tasks and tab
  completion with "cd" exercise.

- Sticky notes: worked ok, but I noticed a lot of students did not ask
  for help. I was keeping an eye on everyone and their computer
  screens and could tell when someone was not following along. Unclear
  if this is because they were struggling with the material, or got
  distracted and fell behind -- I did notice a lot of e-mail and phone
  checking...

- Should perhaps address issue of checking e-mails/phones. Tell them
  they will likely fall behind if they do this often and will not get
  as much out of the workshop as if they focused for 2 hours.
