Thoughts on the ODS workshop --- 2015-07-07
===========================================

**Luke**:

- I felt it went really well.  There were some parts that I probably
  went too fast.  And as I talked with Joel (TATP observer), he
  mentioned just some structural changes, which I agree with.  That
  is, I should have done the end at the beginning (the *why* was at
  the end... not the other way around).
- It was unfortunate that others came late, though it was partly
  expected given the room change and heavy rain.  But oh well...
- One thing I definitely feel we need to do is go over the **basics**
  of SAS, as several times I felt that I needed to discuss basic
  concepts and not the lesson material.
- I said 'basically' too many times... irritating...
