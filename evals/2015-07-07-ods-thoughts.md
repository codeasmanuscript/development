Thoughts on the ODS workshop --- 2015-07-07
===========================================

**Luke**:

- I felt it went really well.  There were some parts that I probably
  went too fast.  And as I talked with Joel (TATP observer), he
  mentioned just some structural changes, which I agree with.  That
  is, I should have done the end at the beginning (the *why* was at
  the end... not the other way around).
- It was unfortunate that others came late, though it was partly
  expected given the room change and heavy rain.  But oh well...
- One thing I definitely feel we need to do is go over the **basics**
  of SAS, as several times I felt that I needed to discuss basic
  concepts and not the lesson material.
- I said 'basically' too many times... irritating...


**Daiva**:

Excellent lesson! I think the students really enjoy listening to you and watching you code. You showed some very useful ways in which ODS could be applied to coding to improve reproducibility and workflow, and I agree that the verbal explanation of why ODS is valuable needs to be stated at the beginning of the lesson. This is the only lesson we don't have slides for. I'm wondering if we should make some, because our learners seem to appreciate having some slides to refer to when they review content on their own. 

If we do create some slides, I think they should include the definition of ODS, reasons why it is useful, and perhaps some things that are on the "cheatsheet". Things like a description of what ODS trace and ODS listing do. I think learners might appreciate seeing these terms and having an explanation of what they mean before starting to code. I know they are on the cheatsheet, but having this on a few introductory slides might be appreciated by the learners.

A few parts of the code went by a little quickly, but it was mainly parts when you were trying something out and the students didn't need to do it too. I think we just need to indicate to the class when they don't need to copy what you're doing. Otherwise this was very well done! Don't worry about the word "basically" :P I doubt anyone would have noticed if you didn't point it out!
 

**General**:

Since I suggested we create slides for this workshop, I just want to elaborate on that point. We'll be revamping all of our slide decks based on feedback we've gotten from learners and our own thoughts. I think we should compact the material in a way that maximizes the quality of info and minimizes the quantity (i.e. fewer, but better slides!) We should definitely incorporate specific, actionable learning objectives into each lesson. Perhaps present those right up front after the title slide, go into the background/explanation material, and then reiterate the learning objectives before we begin live coding. We should aim to keep the time we spend on slides to ~15 minutes and then go right into coding. After the coding is complete we should remember to post the assignment instructions before learners leave.


I think we should also create more code examples that use different statistical tests. This is for both the macros and ODS workshop. I noticed we only use proc means and proc glm, but we can use proc logistic, proc freq and proc ttest too. I'd also like to have examples that use physical data (not human/animal data), so that students in physical sciences/engineering see something that might feel more familiar to their work. I'll work on developing these.
