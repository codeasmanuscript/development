Hello DNSers!

On Friday, February 13 we will be hosting another data-related workshop on statistical assumptions (time and location are in the registration link, please register so we know how many students to expect). If you run linear regression or ANOVA for your analyses, we will be going over some statistical tests in SAS that you can use to confirm that your data fits your linear regression model correctly. We will also present a few other considerations you can evaluate when building a statistical model.

Workshop: Know your data and how to analyze it correctly: Statistical Assumptions

* Register [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/statistical-assumptions-workshop-tips-and-tricks-for-data-related-efficiency-tickets-15622328806)
* Bring a fully charged laptop with SAS installed (if you use some other statistical software program you are still welcome to come, but workshop coding will be done with SAS)
* Bring some of your own research data to try these tests on your own work


Contact Daiva (daiva.nielsen@mail.utoronto.ca) or Luke (luke.johnston@mail.utoronto.ca) if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Daiva & Luke
