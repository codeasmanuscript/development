# Potential workshops to give #

* Data management
* Reproducible research (basics of best practices on coding, folder
  structure, running scripts, etc.)
* How to select the appropriate stat test
* How to handle and find errors and bugs in code
* Proper coding practices
* Tutorial on how coding/programming software works (its important to
  understand to grasp other concepts (e.g. macros, ODS, etc.))

## SAS ##

* Intro to the basics of SAS
* Basic statistics in SAS
* Macros (basic, intermediate, advanced)
* ODS output
    * Mixing in data manipulation/editing
    * Like do one of the other workshops this way, teaching two things
      at once to show that git/VCS should be an integral part of doing
      any analysis.  Like one group figure out what ODS to use, an
      other to build the macro.

* Possible flow of sessions:
    - Intro + data wrangle
    - Basic stats
    - Macros
    - ODS

## R ##

* Intro to the basics of R
* Basics of statistics in R
* ggplot
* Data visualization (I would argue this is more important to teach before other stats methods)
* Functions
* Report generation (R (knitr), pandoc, markdown)

* Possible flow of sessions:
    - Intro + data wrangle
    - ggplot, data viz
    - Basic stats
    - Functions
    - Report generation

## Git ##

* Git or version control in general
    - Maybe do an interactive (using etherpad), team assignment to
      show the benefits of using VCS. Like all create a github
      account, create a practice assignment, and merge/work together
      to do an analysis. Like split the group up into a few teams, get
      one group to generate data, another to analyze it, and another
      to make plots or something simple of course.

* Possible flow of lesson(s):
    - Pair up and alternate between pushers and pullers (owners and
      collaborators)
    - At end of session (last 1 hour)
