# Base plotting systems #

The base plotting system in R is the `plot()` function. 

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

```

# the Lattice system #

This is the second base plotting system in R. Plots are created with a single call function. Margins and spacing are set automatically because the entire plot is specified at once. It is good at putting many plots on a screen and thus you can see things like how y changes with x over z. 

```{r}
library (lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data=state, layout = c(4,1))

```

# ggplot2 #

The ggplot2 package is similar to lattice but it's easier and more intuitive to use. 

 ```{r}
 install.packages("ggplot2")
 ```
