# Assignment: Plotting with ggplot2 #

**We will be using the `diamonds` dataframe included in `ggplot2` for all questions **

1. Use the `qplot()` function to make a scatterplot with x=carat and y=price

2. Now color the plot by the cut. 

3. Change the above scatterplot to a histogram of carat, with the fill color of cut. 

4. Change the binwidth of the histogram to 1

** now to the `ggplot()` function **

5. Use the `ggplot()` function to make an object called `b` with x=color and y=depth. 

6. Make a boxplot out of `b`

7. Add the following titles:
    * Title: Depth and color of round cut diamonds
    * x label: Diamond color, from J(worst) to D(best)
    * y label: Depth (mm)
    
8. Create a `facet_wrap()` using the clarity attribute. Make 4 columns of facets (Hint: use `ncol`. Modifiy the title to say: Depth and color of round cut diamonds by clarity 

9. Make a correlation heat map of all the numeric/integer columns of the diamonds dataset. Round the correlations to 3 digits. BONUS: use piping to solve this problem. HINT: the cor function turns your data into a matrix. Be sure to make this back into a dataframe.
