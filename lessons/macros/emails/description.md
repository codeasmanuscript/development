Hello DNSers!

We're doing another workshop on March 20th from 2-5pm (FG, rm. 423), targeting those who use SAS.

**Title**: Fighting chaos: Coding tricks to keep your analysis -- and mind -- sane (SAS only)

Do you copy and paste you code often, changing only minor things with each repeated code?  Are your SAS files getting bigger and bigger, and it's getting harder to manage?  This workshop we'll be teaching how to make use of some powerful features of SAS to make sure you stay sane until well after you have graduated!

Specifically, we will be teaching how to use macros, recycling code, and reducing much of the manual work when coding in SAS.
