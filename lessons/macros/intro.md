# Outline of workshop --- Macros #

* Introduction
    * Make sure they have git and github
    * Clean code, code as manuscript, sanity
    * What are macros
    * How they are useful
    * Steps-by-step to creating them
        * General rules of thumb for making them
    * Loops
    * Best practices

* Examples:
    * Bad code, good code
        * Daiva make bad code for means
        * Luke make bad code for glm (anova)
        * Both fix it (pre-WS)
    * Example of my macro library
    * Work through proc corr, proc glm, proc means
    * Create their own of a test they use often
    * Use their own data/analysis
    * Or just make up their own

* Exercises:
    * Make bad code (together)
    * Push to github
    * Pull partners bad code
    * Fix it by making macro (together)
    * Push to github

* For future: mention power of combining with ODS
