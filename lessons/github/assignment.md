You need to use GitHub, pushing, and pulling in order to actually get
better at it and to understand what is going on.  Here are some tasks
to complete that will help you along the way.

1. Set up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you haven't
   already.  If you are concerned about having your research or data
   be public you can either a)
   [request](https://education.github.com/) 5 free private repos from
   GitHub or b) use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), which uses
   private repos by default.
2. Create a new [GitHub repo](https://github.com/new) (or in
   [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/repo/create)).
3. Follow the instructions on either GitHub or BitBucket after you
   have created your repo.  Go into the terminal/Git Bash and `cd`
   (change directory) into a folder that contains a git repo that
   you've already created (likely from the [git workshop](../../git/))
   and enter the commands in the instructions.
4. Push (aka. upload) your git repo to your new GitHub/BitBucket
   account.
5. Make some edits to files that are under git on your computer (not
   GitHub) and commit those changes to your git history.  Push those
   changes up to your remote repo.
6. Fork someone else's repo in GitHub (aka. copy someone else's repo
   into your own account). See
   [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for
   instructions.
7. Clone (aka. download) the forked repo into your computer.
8. Make some changes to the new cloned git repo that is now on your
   computer.  Commit those changes into the history.  Then push the
   new changes up to the forked remote repo.
9. (Optional) If you forked a friend's GitHub repo, submit a
   [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   of the changes you made.
