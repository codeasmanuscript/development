## Before coming to the workshop: ##

### Install Git ###

Installing instructions from the [Git download site](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

* On Windows

    Download the installer exe file and run it from this [Github link](http://msysgit.github.io)

* On Mac

    To use the graphical Git installer, download from this [SourceForge link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/)

* On Linux

    Install through your package manager (for example, if you use Ubuntu, run this code: `sudo apt-get install git`

### Getting a text editor ###

Because we will be writing a fake report using something called Markdown, you will need to install a plain text editor (or use a currently installed one).

* Windows

    Notepad is installed by default, however [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.9.html) is really good.  Another option is [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/).

* Mac

    [TextMate](http://macromates.com/download) is good, check the website to install it.

* Linux

    There are a number of good options available to easily install. Check out gedit. Your distro likely has it in its package management repos.

### Using or getting a statistical program ###

We will be using SAS to run analyses.  But! If you don't have it already and don't want to pay the high cost for the SAS license, you can use R (which is free) instead.  Instructions for download can be found at on the [R website](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/).  A good editor for R is [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk).  If you need any help, come a bit early before the workshop and we'll try to help out.
