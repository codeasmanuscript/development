# List of potential exercises here: #

* List item 1
* List item 2

# Challenge: Try this out for yourself! #

1. Make a new dataframe with the means of Agriculture, Examination, Education, and 
Infant.Mortality for each category of Fertility (hint: convert it into a factor
by values >50 vs <50), when Catholic is less than 60 (hint, use `dplyr` commands
+ `gather`).  Have the Fertility groups as two columns.

2. Do the same thing as above, but instead make a new dataframe with one (1) column with that contains the mean and standard deviation in this format: '00.00 (00.00 SD)'. Note that there are two digits after the period.

3. Create a new dataframe with the first column containing the variable names, the second column containing which county has the lowest value of the variable, and a third column containing the county with the highest value of the variable.  For example:

```{r q3Example}
knitr::kable(
    data.frame(Variable = c('Fertility', 'Agriculture'), 
               Lowest = c('Moutier', 'Delemont'),
               Highest = c('Courtelary', 'Porrentruy')))
```
