# Base plotting systems #

The base plotting system in R is the `plot()` function. 

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

```

# the Lattice system #

This is the second base plotting system in R. Plots are created with a single call function. Margins and spacing are set automatically because the entire plot is specified at once. It is good at putting many plots on a screen and thus you can see things like how y changes with x over z.
