R has a 5 basic classes of objects:

* Character
* Numeric
* Integer
* Complex
* Logical

# Vectors #

The most basic object is a vector. A vector is a sequence of objects of the same class

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
