Work in progress...

Version control is a system that manages and organizes different
versions of a file...

* Introductions
    * What we are and are not...

* Best practices on file naming

* Brief lecture on VCS
    * Ask questions regarding sending around drafts, wanting to do
      some experimenting with the analysis so you create other files,
      remembering what you did last time, wishing you hadn't deleted
      something previously, etc.
    * Go over what VCS is, how it can help, and how it is particularly
      (especially!) useful in science as it is a form of
      documentation (like a lab notebook)
    * Go over git commands as a group
    * git configs

* Brief discussion on why it is important to keep things documented,
  organized, and in mainly plain text files/scripts

* Go into exercises
