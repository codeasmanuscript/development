# Assignment: Git #

In order to learn how to use Git, you really need to just start using
it and get some practice!  So, here are some things we would like you
to do:

1. Set global configuration values (see the
  [cheatsheet](cheatsheet/index.html) for more details):
  * user.name
  * user.email
  * color.ui
  * core.editor
  * push.default

2. Create a Git repository (repo) in a folder of your choice.

3. Create a SAS or R file in the folder and write up then run some
   basic code (find the means, print the data).  Save the SAS or R
   file.

4. Check the status of your Git repo.  Make sure that it says
   somewhere that your SAS or R file is "untracked".

5. Add the SAS or R file to your repo.  Check the status to confirm it
   was added.

6. Commit to the repo history and make sure to write up a detailed
   commit message.

7. Check the status of your repo than check the log of your repo.
   Confirm that your commit message was there.

8. Include more basic code into your SAS or R file.  Save it.

9. Compare the file you just saved with the file in your history.
   See the differences you made.  Check the status of your repo.

10. Add the changed file to your repo, commit it, check the status and
    than the log.

11. Create a new file, again with some basic SAS or R code.  Save it
    and than check the status of your git repo.

12. Add and commit the new file into your repo history.

13. Create a branch to experiment with your files and move to that
    branch.  Check the status of your repo.

14. Change or include more code in your files, checking the repo
    status.

15. Add and commit the changed files into your repo history.

16. Check your log.  Now, move back to the master branch.  Confirm
    that you moved by checking your files to make sure they are as in
    the original.
