In order to learn how to use Git, you really need to just start using
it and get some practice!  So, here are some things we would like you
to do:

1. (If not already done) Set global configuration values (see the
  [cheatsheet](cheatsheet/) for more details):
  * user.name
  * user.email
  * color.ui
  * core.editor
  * push.default

2. Create a Git repository (repo) in a folder of your choice.

3. Create a plain *text* file and name it `your-name-bio.txt` where
   `your-name` is... well your name!  Write a brief bio about yourself
   and save it:
   * Your name
   * Your program
   * Types of analyses you normally do

4. Check the status of your Git repo.  Make sure that it says
   somewhere that your file is "untracked".

5. Add the file to your repo.  Check the status to confirm it was
   added.

6. Commit to the repository history and make sure to write up a
   descriptive commit message.

7. Check the status of your repo than check the log of your repo.
   Confirm that your commit message was there.

8. Write in the bio file your understanding of what version control is
   and why you think it may (or may not) be important.  Save it.

9. Compare the file you just saved with the file in your history.
   See the differences you made.  Check the status of your repo.

10. Add the changed file to your repo, commit it, check the status and
    than the log.

11. Create a new file (named `your-name-thoughts.txt`) and this time
    type out your thoughts on the git workshop, the good and the bad
    (be detailed, we really do want to hear your thoughts!).  Save it
    and than check the status of your git repo.

12. Add and commit the new file into your repo history.

13. Create a branch to experiment with your files and move to that
    branch.  Check the status of your repo.

14. Change or edit your files however you please, checking the repo
    status.

15. Add and commit the changed files into your repo history.

16. Check your log.  Now, move back to the master branch.  Confirm
    that you moved by checking your files to make sure they are as in
    the original.
