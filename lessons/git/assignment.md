In order to learn how to use Git, you really need to just start using
it and get some practice!  So, here are some things we would like you
to do:

* Config global values:
    * user.name
    * user.email
    * color.ui
    * core.editor
    * push.default

* Work individually

* Have them pull the git workshop with cheatsheet and slides.

* So import sas dataset, export to csv file in the data/ folder

* Create different analyses, output different data, all the while
  commiting the changes.

* Create a branch to experiment with

* Create a branch for code to input into your presentation or
  manuscript

* Write up a brief fake report, make changes, go back.

*Developing*

1. Write a simple SAS script
