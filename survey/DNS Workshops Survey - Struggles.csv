N/A-Currently doing background reading,N/A,N/A haven't started yet
have not yet started research,have not yet started,have not yet started
have not yet started research,choosing correct test,N/A-Haven't looked at data yet
appropriate methods to clean data prior to analysis,Choosing the correct test and learning what it means,don't know
Being time efficinet with large data,choosing the right test,Na
choosing the right test,choosing the right test,NA
choosing the right test & the best way to program it in SAS,choosing the right test,NA
choosing the right test and how to apply it,converting results into organizable format,"""hurry up and wait"" - i.e. get everything ready for an analysis and then have to wait for everyone to review it etc"
choosing the right test and learning how to apply it,Data cleaning,Best way of reporting the data
choosing the right test and learning how to apply it,getting data into a form that is easy to analyze,choosing right test and applying it
Choosing which statistical test to use on data,getting data into a format,cleaning data
cleaning the data,getting data into a format that can be analyzed,Cleaning up the data takes a long time and I feel that I could utilize my time better if I learnt other techniques to organize my data.
efficiently coding (eg. using macro's),getting data into format that can be analyzed,data formating
Formatting data for analysis with specific software,Getting data into format that can be analyzed,I find it really overwhelming to analyze such a large data set.
managing and cleaning data,getting results into right format into tables,"I want to shoot myself in the face when I'm doing my work. I'd rather be doing anything else, like arm-wrestling gorillas playing chess with Jean Claude Van Dam."
Managing and cleaning data,Getting results into the right format,learning macro options
Managing and cleaning data,getting results into the right format to put into tables and manuscripts,Learning new SAS code
managing and cleaning data,Graphs,managing multiple versions
managing and cleaning my data,Handling data that does not fit parametric assumptions,presenting the results in graph form (using SAS or R)
managing data,"I would like new formats for SAS output, eg excel, & better table style",reference organization and graph titles
"managing large data sets, converting format of data",interpretation from software output,results in right format to put in table and manuscripts
managing large datasets,Making tables in SAS,sometimes with interpreting
Managing/cleaning data,managing lots of outputs,synthesizing the final effects of a treatment
managing/cleaning data,Minitab is very limited in its functions (can do multivariate regression but cannot do multivariate ANOVA). I would love to learn more about how to use SAS,The underlying assumptions for selecting certain tests for the data analysis
putting results in a graph in the right format for manuscripts,Organizing your data,"unifyiing units of measurement for meta-analysis, choosing co-founders or controling for factors if not pre-specified"
To be more efficient in Excel (sifting through cells and cells of data takes forever!),outputing data into the right format,Using SAS
Writing code in SAS,,"various decisions regarding the data: how to treat the missing data, determine which data is an outlier, etc."
