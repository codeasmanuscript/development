Would you like to learn how you can use your computer to to manage your data and files more efficiently? Join us for our very first "DNS Tips and Tricks for Data Efficiency" workshop hosted by PhD candidate Luke Johnston and recent grad Daiva Nielsen. Luke and Daiva have completed a Software Carpentry workshop held at Mozilla Science Lab in Toronto and want to share this incredibly useful knowledge with fellow DNS students.


Our 4 session, weekly workshop will teach you how to use programs like Git to more efficiently track changes you make to your files, so that you don't end up with numerous copies of a work-in-progress document in your folders. We'll show you how you can condense writing statistical codes to perform multiple tests and reduce the risk of typing errors. There are other data-related topics we can cover, but first we would like to know more about what you are interested in learning.


The workshops will be held in late October, so if you're interested in signing up please complete our brief 10 question survey at the link below by Friday, September 12. This survey will give us a better idea of what you'd like to learn, which will enable us to customize our learning objectives to better suit your needs.
