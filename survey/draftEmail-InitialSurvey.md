Would you like to learn how you can use your computer to to manage your data and files more efficiently? Join us for our very first "DNS Tips and Tricks for Data Efficiency" workshop hosted by PhD candidate Luke Johnston and recent grad Daiva Nielsen.

We (Luke and Daiva) both work on data- and analysis-heavy projects and have learned from experience and from various workshops some tricks and "tools" that help make analysis easier. We want to share this incredibly useful knowledge and skills with fellow DNS students.


We are planning a series of workshops that will teach you how to use programs (ie. Git) to more efficiently track changes you make to your files, so that you don't end up with numerous copies of a work-in-progress document in your folders. We'll show you how you can condense writing statistical codes to perform multiple tests and reduce the risk of typing errors. There are other data-related topics we can cover, but first we would like to know more about what you are interested in learning.


The first workshop will be held in late October, so if you're interested in signing up please complete our brief 10 question survey at the link below by Friday, September 12. This survey will give us a better idea of what you'd like to learn and areas of your analysis that you may struggle with, which will enable us to customize our learning objectives to better suit your needs.
