# Initial survey: Questions to ask on times, software, etc. #

Where we can develop the questions for doing the initial survey that
would get information on what times are good for people, what software
is mostly used, and what they may best benefit from.

## Potential Questions ##

1. Which topics would you be interested in learning about? Select as
   many as you wish.
    * Data visualization
    * Statistical techniques
    * Best practices in doing analyses in SAS or R
    * Data management
    * Best practices in version control (e.g. sending your draft
      paper around for edits)
    * Better understanding how coding and programming work

2. Which statistical software do you use (e.g. SAS, R, SPSS, etc.)?

3. Do you own a laptop with this software installed?
    * Yes/No

4. a) What statistics do you normally/often use in your analyses? b)
   Would you be interested in learning more about how they work and
   checking their assumptions (e.g. ANOVA assumes normal distributions
   of its variables)?
