# Initial survey: Questions to ask on times, software, etc. #

Where we can develop the questions for doing the initial survey that
would get information on what times are good for people, what software
is mostly used, and what they may best benefit from.

## Potential Questions ##

0. a) What is your name? b) What program are you in? c) What year are
   you into your program?

1. Which topics would you be interested in learning about? Select as
   many as you wish.
    * Exploring your data visually using graphs (in R or SAS)
    * Common statistical techniques
    * Best practices in doing analyses in SAS or R
    * Tips and tricks to be more efficient and productive in writing up your SAS or R analysis
    * Managing, cleaning, and massaging your data into a suitable format for analysis 
    * Best practices in version control (e.g. sending your draft
      paper around for edits)
    * Techniques to automate and make easier for putting your results into your manuscript 
    * Better understanding how coding and programming work

2. Which statistical software do you use (e.g. SAS, R, SPSS, etc.)?

3. Do you own a laptop with this software installed?
    * Yes/No

4. a) What statistics do you normally/often use in your analyses? 

4. b) Would you be interested in learning more about how they work and
   checking their assumptions (e.g. ANOVA assumes normal distributions
   of its variables)?
   
5. Please describe two predominant aspects of your research you struggle the most with and/or is most time consuming (eg. Managing and cleaning your data, getting your data into a format that can be analyzed, choosing the right test and learning how to apply it, getting results into the right format to put into tables and manuscripts, etc.). 

6. Please describe other, secondary aspects of your research that you find difficult, challenging, and/or time consuming. 

7. If a series of workshops were set up on all things data related, what times would be best for running them? Select as many options that apply. 
    * (should we do a link to doodle or something?) 
    * Thursday after seminar? 
    * Tuesday afternoon?
