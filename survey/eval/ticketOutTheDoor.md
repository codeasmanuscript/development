# Ticket out the door survey #

To be completed at the end of each workshop.

Emphasis that any feedback is immensely helpful for us to improve our
workshops!

## Possible questions ##

What was the workshop topic today?

How well did you follow along? Was it too fast, too slow, too
difficult, not explained well, etc?

How clearly was the content explained and demonstrated?

Was the activity useful? Did you feel it helped reinforce what was
taught?

What could we improve (either with the material or with the teaching)?

For a more "quantitative" feedback, how would you rate the workshop
overall?
