# Our todo list:

* We should think about how we can record participants thoughts and feelings on the workshops, what we can improve, what worked, etc.  This is also good for developing our teaching dossiers for future jobs.  What do you think?
      * Something like a "ticket out the door" or a paper survey they finish after the workshop.
* Write up a description + tag lines for the workshop, that best
  explains what it is
* Make a name for our workshops (e.g. "Journal Club" for going over
  articles)
* Confirm with Anthea about email
* Create an etherpad.mozilla team account or use public pad?
* Make an organization github account?
