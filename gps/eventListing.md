# Code As Manuscript: Data wrangling, visualization, and reproducibility in R ##

## About this Event

Date:

This series of *hands-on* workshops aims to introduce students to the
concept of research reproducibility and to get the students practicing
with using version control systems and with using modern techniques in
R that make analyses less error prone and reproducible, and that make
you more efficient, productive, and in control.  Techniques for using
version control systems to faciliate greater collaboration among peers
are also taught.  The ultimate goal of the workshop is to show how to
reduce the number of steps needed to go from the initial data analysis
to the final written manuscript or thesis (hence the name *Code As
Manuscript*).
